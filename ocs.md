title: Off Campus Study Visualizations

## Project Summary 

The IGE & Off-Campus Study Visualizations: R Shiny App is created to visualize data of past students who studied off-campus for a semester while enrolled at Grinnell College. ​
Users can visualize where off-campus programs are held, which programs are available, and where students have traveled in the past. ​It allows prospective and current students to explore the different programs through various visualizations. ​Students can interact with a map, see different demographics of people visiting different regions using line graphs and different segmented bar charts. ​Lastly, students can also compare costs for off campus programs with a semester at Grinnell College. 

The Shiny app can be found [here](https://caitlinabreu.shinyapps.io/IGE_and_Off_Campus_Study_Visualizations/).
