## Personal Portfolio 

Hello! My name is Ishita Sarraf and this is my portfolio that I have created using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. 

My website covers my research interests, projects, and publications. Feel free to go through my portfolio [here](https://ishita-17.github.io)! 

I am a rising fourth-year undergraduate studying Computer Science at Grinnell College, IA. I am interested in pursuing a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in studying various types of biases such as gender and racial biases in AI algorithms' training data.
