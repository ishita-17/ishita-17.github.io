title:  Week 4- 14 June 2024
---

Week 4 has been interesting. We finally were able to implement the robot to learn how to move the cup from the start to end state using QLearning Reinforcement Learning algorithm on Tuesday. It was really satisfying to watch it work! Elaine was very happy with our progress! Our next steps are to convert that code to a generalizable Markov Decision Process code which has been a tough process. For the rest of the week, we spent the entire time restructuring the code. There is still work to be done on that. For the weekend, I had family visiting Boston, so I spent the weekend roaming around the city and going to good places to eat.
