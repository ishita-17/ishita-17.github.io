title: Week 2

My second week involved a lot of learning. I compared between different Python libraries to decide which to use for my work. I am working on Crossref API with Python and eventually settled on using it with the habanero Python library. I have to maintain a lab notebook where I document all my findings and justifications for my methods. I completed creating a pipeline that will extract full-text in XML and PDF form and store it in a MongoDB database as long as the DOI supplied is in an open-access database. I need to work on the publications that are not open access and handle their licenses for text and data mining. Along with that, I have to give a presentation regarding my project description, goals, and timeline next week so I started creating the first draft of the presentation to get feedback from both my mentors. I also attended the weekly lab meeting where we saw presentations from students and also discussed possible social activites. I also went for a sexual harrasment workshop and an ice cream social event. These events are hosted by the university for students doing research for the summer. Overall, it was a good week.
