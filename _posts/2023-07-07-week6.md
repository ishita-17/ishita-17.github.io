I finally submitted my extended abstract for the SIGMET 2023 workshop!! This was a significant achievement for me as it was my first-ever submission to any conference!! I will learn by August 1 whether I was accepted or not. The conference will be held in London which is where I am studying next semester for my study abroad semester, hence if I get accepted,
I can attend the conference in person which will be a great experience for me! The Tuesday of this week was the 4th of July and I saw the fireworks celebration for the first time. It was a beautiful experience, the fireworks lasted for 30 mins and were very beautiful. The celebrations happened in a huge parking lot and the entire city of Champaign had gathered
there. I went there with my housemates and we had a wonderful time!! At work, after submitting the abstract, I was working with the Wiley TDM API, I got a token but it is still not 
letting me access the full text, even those marked as open access. I need to figure out their licenses in the coming weeks so that I can incorporate that into my full text extraction
pipeline. I also updated my poster which I will be presenting for the STEM and CAREER Symposium that will happen on campus on July 26. We have to send the poster for printing this 
week. On the weekend, I went to buy groceries with my housemate, we went to an Indian grocery store on campus and another Asian grocery store and bought boba later. It was a 
good weekend!
