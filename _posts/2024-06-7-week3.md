This week we finally made progress with using the robot arm. Elaine was not here for the lab meeting as she had too many meetings so Reuben (the postdoc) helped Anisha and I make progress with using the robot arm. With his help and a few other graduate students in the lab, we were able to implement a Q-Learning algorithm for a 3x3 grid.There is still work to be done to make the robot arm as we were having complications with that. Next steps would be to fix the robot arm issue and then make it pick up a cup and make it drop the cup in the terminal grid. For the weekend I was mostly just cleaning my room, getting groceries, and exploring the neighborhoods in Somerville. I am looking forward to fixing the bugs in our code in the coming weeks.
