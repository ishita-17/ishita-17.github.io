title: Week 10

**LAST WEEK!** This was officially my last day and week of the DREU program. I cannot believe it is over already. I feel as if I had just started all my work and was nervous about
messing things up. It is crazy how fast time passed. I have learned so much and met so many amazing people. I submitted an extended abstract, gave an oral presentation at a conference, 
attended multiple lab meetings, and got to write so much about the work I am doing. The final report took most of my time this week, it is still not over and I will have to work on it
when I get home as well. I will continue to work on the paper with Heng when he needs to submit it for the JCDL conference and will hopefully attend the London conference for my poster. 
Jodi and Yuanxi gave me great feedback about my work and how I should improve. I could met grad students in the field I am interested in and they gave me good tips about how to apply for
grad schools and how to reach out to professors. Jodi agreed to write me a recommendation letter for applications when the time comes and I am glad about that. My roommates and I went
out for dinner one last time and then the rest of the time I kept packing up my room. Champaign truly started feeling like home and I am going to miss this place.
