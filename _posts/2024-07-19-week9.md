The second last week was a blur of editing my final report and presenting for the lab. I gave a 10 minute presentation to the lab about my entire project including my findings. It was a good experience as I could give the lab an overview of my entire summer and could answer their questions about it. Some of the questions were difficult because the lab members were more informative about my topic than I was - which makes sense because they have been studying these topics for a lot longer than I have. My final report is a work in progress. Thankfully, I had the original paper to start off with as a sample but it is difficult to write algorithms and background about a topic that is not that familiar to me but I am excited to complete it and finish my internship.
