title: Week 9

The STEM and CAREER Exploration Symposium was the highlight of this week. I gave my first oral presentation, attended many poster sessions and other oral presentations, and also got to meet many local industry professionals. The conference was a very fun-filled but tiring day. It was a little scary to be giving an oral presentation in front of an audience even though I had practiced my presentation in the lab earlier. However, it was a great experience. Apart from the conference, all the lab members also went for a social outing- we went out for lunch to a great Chinese restaurant called Golden Harbour and ordered a lot of delicious food. It was Jodi's treat and the restaurant had a wide variety of vegetarian options
which was a great delight for me. I discussed future work plans with Jodi and we started working on a project with a postdoc student, Heng, whom I had interviewed as part of my 
requirements analysis for the project initially. I worked on the pipeline and edited it to input and output text files and got results for his use case that were needed for a paper
he will be writing. I am excited about being part of an actual paper! I went out with my roommates for boba and ramen, I will  miss them too! I can't believe I will soon be leaving. The other DREU student had to leave this week only because of housing leases, so I went out with her for ice cream one last time. This time next week I will be bidding this place goodbye as well.
