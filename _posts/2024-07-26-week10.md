**LAST WEEK!!** It is officially the end of my DREU 2024 experience. I had an amazing time learning about reinforcement learning, policy shaping, and working with a real-life robot. Learning how to implement my own algorithms and analysing its results taught me a lot about human-robot interaction. I spent this week polishing my final report - I learnt how to use LATEX to create multi-columns for the formatting for the report. I have learned a lot from this internship - new software, living in Medford, exploring Boston, and working on PhD and fellowship applications. I am excited to go home after this internship and relax for a month and then apply for graduate school.
