This week had some challenges. I had to parse XML files and realised they are a lot more complicated than I thought. There are multiple formats for XML files and my code needs
to be generic enough for every format. The XML formats are determined by publishers, I think, which is why it is harder to generalise the files because there are so many 
different publishers for scholarly publications. I did more work for my abstract, I started writing the sections. My mentors will be travelling so I need to finish major things before
their travel to get proper feedback. I also started work on the 0th poster which I will need to present for the STEM and CAREER Symposium. I attended a seminar on Imposter Syndrome 
which was quite enlightening and had activities throughout the workshop that were fun. The weekend passed by really fast, I went to a nice Italian place for pizza once and roamed 
around the campus a lot. I am hoping to get more work done on XML Parsing in the coming weeks so that I can move on to other parts of the project as well.
