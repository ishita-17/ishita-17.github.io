title:  Week 8- 13 July 2024
---

I cannot believe week 8 is over and I only have 2 more weeks left in the program. Time has flown by!! This week I spent time conducting tests on the algorithms - I increased the scope from a 3x3 grid to a 7x7 grid and conducted lots of statistical tests. My tests got significant results for the new algorithms - they showed that the 2 algorithms are significantly (p < 0.05) different from the original algorithm but not very different from each other. These results are great!! I started writing my report with the help of a template given by Elaine and the original paper's format. I am going to conduct more tests to collect more data for the report in the coming weeks. My course is basically over - they need me to submit the final proposal next week. In the weekend I plan to mostly relax and spend some time in the neighborhood as I will have to leave very soon.
