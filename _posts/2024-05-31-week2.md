title:  Week 2- 31 May 2024
---

The week was mostly spent on understanding how to start using ROS and reading different papers on Q-Learning Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning tutorials, and Policy Shaping algorithms. I also met Elaine (my mentor) in-person this week in lab meeting. It was a 4-day week because it was Memorial Day. I spent my weekend going out with Anisha (the other DREU student) and we spent a day exploring the Cambridge area and got ice cream. In the coming week, we are planning on getting started with working with the robot arm and finding out our tasks.
