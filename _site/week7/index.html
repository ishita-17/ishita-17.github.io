    <p>Itâ€™s crazy how the 7th week got over so soon. It seems like yesterday that I just started the work. This week was mostly working on oral presentations, posters, abstracts,
and the DREU final report. I will be giving 2 oral presentations for the STEM and Career Symposium (July 26) and the iSchool Colloquium (Aug 2). I had to submit an abstract
for the Symposium. The Wiley TDM API is giving problems because of its licenses and Jodi and I reached out to their customer care team. Hopefully, next week we will know
how to deal with it. I gave my code for review to 2 lab members and will be making updates according to their suggestions in the last few weeks. I attended 2 workshops on
Resume and LinkedIn profiles and how to better maintain a professional portfolio and network. I attended an all-day Illinois Summer Research Symposium on Friday, July 14. There
were mostly graduate students presenting their summer research and posters. Some undergraduates were also there. The Symposium was amazing! I saw so many posters and spoke to a 
lot of people! I learned a lot about how research goes and can be of so many different types. The weekend was spent in mostly working on my oral presentation.</p>
