    <p><strong>FIRST WEEK!!</strong> My first week was fun and unexpected at the same time. I met my new housemates with whom I will be living for the summer. Along with that, on my first day of work, I was introduced to the people in the lab along with my PhD mentor Yuanxi and co-researcher Doreen who is also here from DREU. We spent a lot of time touring the building and campus with Yuanxi and our profesor Jodi. The campus is quite huge and very different from my liberal arts school. 
It has been a fun but exhausting experience roaming around the city and making 3 meals everyday. I am trying to stay fit by going to the gym as well. I canâ€™t pay for the college gym as it is too expensive but my apartment has a small gym I am going to. That gym is not as great as I would have hoped but better than paying $97 for 2 months for the college gym. Dr. Jodi was very nice to sponsor the bus travel for Doreen and I, so atleast I do not have to worry about going around in the city. 
The work is challenging and interesting. I am reading the documentation of Crossref API so that I can implement it to extract full-text from given DOIs which I will later text mine. But for now, I watched videos about the API and read the documentation to have a better idea about the process. It is an entirely foreign API for me and hence, it will take some time to understand it. I will make more progress on implementing the pipeline in the coming weeks.</p>
