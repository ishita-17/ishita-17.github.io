    <p>Week 3 was a blur. I had to give a presentation to the lab regarding my project goals and timeline. I worked on that presentation the entire week. My presentation started off with a background for why my project is needed, followed by an important definition, my main goals, a case study, a 5 step plan to achieve my goals, and a timeline. My professor and PhD mentor gave me lots of feedback throughout the week and I had to make many edits constantly. This was an experience of how iterative all work in the lab is. Additionally, I interviewed another lab member as part of the Requirement Analysis of my project. I also had to start working on reading samples for abstracts since I am trying to send my poster to METSTI workshop 2023 which is a workshop at the annual ASIS&amp;T conference. I have to write a 2-page extended abstract for my project and if I get selected I will get a chance to virtually present my poster. Another cool thing I did was attend a PhD defence. I got to sit in and hear the presentation and question-answers and realised just how much work a PhD is. It was really fun to watch the defence and see the student pass their exam.</p>
