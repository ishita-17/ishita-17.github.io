      <p> I am a third year undergraduate major in Computer Science with a concentration in Statistics
        at Grinnell College, Iowa, USA. My research interests lie in the field of Human Computer
        Interaction with Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in researching about bias in AI 
        algorithms, especially racial and gender bias in training data for AI algorithms. 
        For the summer of 2024, I am going to Tufts University in the School of Engineering
        to work with <a href = "https://eshort.github.io">Dr. Elaine Short</a> at the <a href="https://aabl.cs.tufts.edu">AABL Lab</a> 
        as part of the Distributed Research Experience for Undergraduates organized by Computing 
        Research Association.
