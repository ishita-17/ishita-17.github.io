**FIRST WEEK!!** I had a great first week! It was really exciting and everyone at my lab was
really welcoming. My mentor, Elaine was sick so I only met her once during lab meeting via Zoom
but most of my work was simply going through the onboarding document which has tutorials on 
basic Python, numpy, linux, as well as ROS - the software needed to run the robots. I love my
off-campus house, it is a 20 minute walk away from my lab. I am excited to venture more into 
the work.
